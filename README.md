## Engineering Approach

We prioritize:

- Explicit architectural boundaries  
- Modular and maintainable codebases  
- Typed systems and structured data modeling  
- Performance and scalability awareness  
- Version-controlled, review-driven workflows  
- Security-conscious implementation  

We avoid:

- Hidden system behavior  
- Unjustified architectural complexity  
- Short-term solutions that create long-term technical debt  

Engineering decisions are deliberate and trade-offs are documented.

## Technology Focus

Our primary stack typically includes:

- **Flutter** for cross-platform development  
- Typed backend services  
- Relational data modeling  
- CI-driven development pipelines  

Technology choices are guided by operational clarity and durability — not trends.
